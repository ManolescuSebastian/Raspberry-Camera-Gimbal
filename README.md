# Raspberry-Camera-Gimbal

Raspberry Pi API project that provides two video streaming options and stepper motor movement 360Â° rotation.</br>

**Youtube video:**

The main API endpoints for this projects are for camera movement and video stream </br>

**/api/stepper** with query params </br>

- move = up
- move = down
- move = right
- move = down
- move = stop

**/stream.mjpg**  </br>
This endpoint is used for video streaming.

But we also have another option for video streaming that is more faster/better video quality </br>
In stream_server (https://github.com/ManolescuSebastian/Raspberry-Camera-Gimbal/tree/master/CameraGimbal/stream_server) we have the a standalone server that requires to run on a **different port**. </br>
More information here: https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.10/recipes1.html

### How to start
In order to start the server first we need to add a **base URL** in MainApp.py (or CameraStream.py if you are using the streaming server). <br>
To find out your Raspberry Pi IP open a terminal and type ifconfig (192.168.1.X)<br>
Add rapspberry IP to MainApp.py in the last code line (e.q. app.run(debug=True, port=5050, **host='192.168.1. todo'**,threaded=True)) or/and if you are using CameraStream.py add it to  address = (**'192.168.1.todo'**, 5020) <br>

**Note:** You can add any port you want (5050, 5020) was a personal choice.<br>

After the steps above are completed open a terminal and type<br>
**python MainApp.py** or/and **python CameraStream.py** <br>

### Libraries required in order to run this project
